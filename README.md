# File_Tools
Collection of Scripts that I've made with file tools to increase efficiency and productivity for operations on a large set of files
The project was originally started in November 2024, and I created the repo in March 2025 to keep track of everything and allow others to contribute!
Each script creates a log file under File_Tools/logs/[Abbreviated Script Name]/

## Match File Renamer (MFR)
This script is meant to look for files with similar names and change the input file to match the file names of the "source" file with a similar name, created for the use of large amount of files needing to be renamed to match another folder with a very large amount of files.

## Copy File Names (CFN)
This script is meant to copy ONLY the name and extension of files in a directory and paste it into another designated directory as an empty file. Mainly created for testing purposes.
